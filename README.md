# Chrome Extension
I wanted the simplest form of a Chrome Extension possible. This extension simply injects a JavaScript code into every page you visit.

Make a folder with name you wish. Put these files (README.md file can be skipped) in it & then load the extension (Load unpacked extension) in Chrome (under settings). Make sure to allow "Developer mode" to enable the button for "Load unpacked extension".
